# StORM: Swift ORM

Core StORM Library



StORM is a modular ORM for Swift, layered on top of Perfect.

It aims to be easy to use, but flexible, and maintain consistency between datasource implementations for the user: you, the developer. It tries to allow you to write great code without worrying about the details of how to interact with the database.
